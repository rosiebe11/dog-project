## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the Data Science Nanodegree! The overall aim of this project is to create a CNN that when given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, the notebook will walk through important design decisions about the user experience for the classifier. The notebook looks at multiple approaches to show the strenghs and weakness of different CNNS and gain a better understanding of the data. 

### Libraries used in the project
Keras
Matplotlib
NumPy
OpenCV

### File descriptions
- dog_app.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing implementation of CNN to classify breeds of dogs
- dog_app.html: Jupyter notebook rendered in html format
- weights.best.from_scratch.hdf5, weights.best.VGG16.hdf5, weights.best.VGG10.hdf5: Weight of CNN model build from scratch, and CNN model via transfer learning utilizing VGG16 and VGG19 architecture
- /images folder: contains images used to test the model.

### Findings
The final architecture used transfer learning and VGG19 pre-trained model to achieve an accuracy of approx 80%. 

### Conclusion
The capstone project walks through the implementation of a CNN network. The steps taken to improve our understanding of similar neural networks and ultimately build the final CNN are detailed below:
1. Import dataset
2. Detect human faces in images 
3. Detect dog in images 
4. Create CNN to classify dog breeds from scratch
5. Use CNN to classify dog breeds via transfer learning 
6. Create CNN to classify dog breeds via transfer learning 
7. Write an algorithm to predict breeds using real world images

It was shown that training effective CNNs take a lot of time to train the model. In these cases, using transfer learning of pre-trained models and altering the final architecture slightly at the end is an effective way of overcoming this. A good accuracy can be achieved using this method. 

Although it was not possible in this project, the accuracy could have been improved further through
1. Increasing the training dataset
2. Augmenting the training data.

If you would like to run this notebook, follow the instructions below.

## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```	
git clone https://github.com/udacity/dog-project.git
cd dog-project
```

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`. 

3. Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 

4. Donwload the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.

5. (Optional) __If you plan to install TensorFlow with GPU support on your local machine__, follow [the guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) to install the necessary NVIDIA software on your system.  If you are using an EC2 GPU instance, you can skip this step.

6. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, create (and activate) a new environment.

	- __Linux__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/dog-linux.yml` to `requirements/dog-linux-gpu.yml`): 
	```
	conda env create -f requirements/dog-linux.yml
	source activate dog-project
	```  
	- __Mac__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/dog-mac.yml` to `requirements/dog-mac-gpu.yml`): 
	```
	conda env create -f requirements/dog-mac.yml
	source activate dog-project
	```  
	**NOTE:** Some Mac users may need to install a different version of OpenCV
	```
	conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
	```
	- __Windows__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/dog-windows.yml` to `requirements/dog-windows-gpu.yml`):  
	```
	conda env create -f requirements/dog-windows.yml
	activate dog-project
	```

7. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)** and Step 6 throws errors, try this __alternative__ step to create your environment.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/requirements.txt` to `requirements/requirements-gpu.txt`): 
	```
	conda create --name dog-project python=3.5
	source activate dog-project
	pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
	```
	**NOTE:** Some Mac users may need to install a different version of OpenCV
	```
	conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
	```
	- __Windows__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/requirements.txt` to `requirements/requirements-gpu.txt`):  
	```
	conda create --name dog-project python=3.5
	activate dog-project
	pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
	```
	
8. (Optional) **If you are using AWS**, install Tensorflow.
```
sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements/requirements-gpu.txt
```
	
9. Switch [Keras backend](https://keras.io/backend/) to TensorFlow.
	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
		```
		KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
		```
	- __Windows__: 
		```
		set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
		python -c "from keras import backend"
		```

10. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `dog-project` environment. 
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name dog-project --display-name "dog-project"
```

11. Open the notebook.
```
jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
```

12. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, before running code, change the kernel to match the dog-project environment by using the drop-down menu (**Kernel > Change kernel > dog-project**). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.

__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.__

## Evaluation

Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the CNN project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/810/view).  Review this rubric thoroughly, and self-evaluate your project before submission.  All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.

## Project Submission

When you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload:
- The `dog_app.ipynb` file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
- An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name `report.html` or `report.pdf`.
- Any additional images used for the project that were not supplied to you for the project. __Please do not include the project data sets in the `dogImages/` or `lfw/` folders.  Likewise, please do not include the `bottleneck_features/` folder.__

Alternatively, your submission could consist of the GitHub link to your repository.
